# machine_defect
This project is a FastAPI-based machine learning application that predicts manufacturing defect status based on various production parameters. Users can upload datasets, train the model, and make predictions via API endpoints. The system ensures efficient data processing with preprocessing and scaling techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
